    <P id="big">BIG BANG THEORIES</P>
    <p id="theory">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy,
        physics, philosophy, and metaphysics. The following
        is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:
    </p>

    <br>
    <p id="bmw">BIG BANG THEORY</p>
    <p id="cls">This is the most recent theory explaining the
        origin and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang
        theory suggests that the history of the universe began
        with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a result
        of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created,
        leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

        <p id="hole">BLACK HOLE THEORY</p>
        <p id="good">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive
            stars. These are regions where gravity is so intense
            that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes
            interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.

    <p id="string">STRING THEORY</p>
    <div>
        <p id="bad">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified
            description of the physical world. According to this
            theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth,
            but the cosmos might contain additional microscopic,
            non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are
            part of confined spaces with different sizes and characteristics.
        </p>
    </div>
        <p id="well">Here are three key points about String Theory:</p>
    <div class="ball">
        <span>
        </span>
        <p id="all">Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide
            a single framework that explains all fundamental forces and particles in
            the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
        </p>

        </span>
        <p id="space">Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string
            theory proposes the existence of additional microscopic dimensions that
            are compactified, potentially influencing the laws of physics.
        </p>

    <div class="ball">
        <span>
        </span>
        <p id="type">Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental
            building blocks of matter are not point-like particles but rather
            one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
            with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.
